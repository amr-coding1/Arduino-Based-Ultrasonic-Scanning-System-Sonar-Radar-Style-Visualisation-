# Arduino-Based-Ultrasonic-Scanning-System-Sonar-Radar-Style-Visualisation-
Designed and implemented an Arduino-based ultrasonic scanning system using a rotating servo-mounted HC-SR04 sensor. The system measures object distance as a function of angle and streams real-time data over serial to a Processing GUI for polar-style visualisation, emulating a basic radar/sonar system.
